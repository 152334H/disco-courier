#Disco-Courier
_A data-mover-and-shaker for Disco Elysium._

##Setup:

- clone the repo
- run _npm install_
- place a copy of your exported data in /data/dialog.json
- run a health check: npm run courier:health

If everything is setup correctly, you'll get a json response with the details of the game's "FYS" attribute (...get it? ...Health check? ...GET IT?)
